hello_python
============

This is a simple starter project that focused on extending a simple pipeline.

The pipeline will load all "steps" and run them

To extend this, simply write your own step and add it to the config, then run the pipeline

Deployed the application on Heroku:
http://glowing-rain-5109.herokuapp.com/

The above URL will mimic the case when "Hello Python" is passed to the pipeline.

Custom Strings can be passed to the pipelines by the following way:
http://glowing-rain-5109.herokuapp.com/<CustomString>
